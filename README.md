### Breaking Cycles in Noisy Hierarchies  - Description

> Taxonomy graphs that capture hyponymy or meronymy relationships through directed edges are expected to be acyclic. However, in practice, they may have thousands of cycles, as they are often created in a crowd-sourced way. Since these cycles represent logical fallacies, they need to be removed for many web applications. In this paper, we address the problem of breaking cycles while preserving the logical structure (hierarchy) of a directed graph as much as possible. Existing approaches for this problem either need manual intervention or use heuristics that can critically alter the taxonomy structure. In contrast, our approach infers graph hierarchy using a range of features, including a Bayesian skill rating system and a social agony metric. We also devise several strategies to leverage the inferred hierarchy for removing a small subset of edges to make the graph acyclic. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

#### 0. Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Lib(s): [networkx](https://networkx.org/) 2.7+

#### 1. Generate Random Graphs (DAGs)

```
python generate_random_dag.py -n 300 -m 2500 -g data/gnm_300_2500.edges
```

* n: number of nodes
* m: number of edges 
* g: file path used to save the generated random graph

#### 2. Introduce Cycles to DAG

```
python introduce_cycles_to_DAG.py -g data/gnm_300_2500.edges -k 300 -l 0
```
* -g:  target DAG edges list file 
* -k: number of extra edges introduced to make DAG have cycles 
* -l: threshold to control path length, if l <=0, no constraints on path length, else: path length < l (cycle length <= l)

output:
 
*  extra_edges_file (**Ground Truth Edges**): gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
*  graph_with_extra_edges_file : gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges

#### 3. Breaking Cycles by DFS

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_dfs.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges 
```

You can specificity a edges list of file as ground truth (edges should be removed to break cycles)  by using '-t'. It will report precision, recall and F-1 score.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_dfs.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
``` 

Performance will be:


#### 4. Breaking Cycles by MFAS

Local greedy implementation of Minimum feedback arc set problem.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_minimum_feedback_arc_set_greedy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

You can specificity a edges list of file as ground truth (edges should be removed to break cycles)  by using '-t'. It will report precision, recall and F-1 score.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_minimum_feedback_arc_set_greedy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

#### 5. Breaking Cycles via Hierarchy, inferred by PageRank

Graph hierarchy is inferred from PageRank.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -s pagerank -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

* -s pagerank: use pagerank to infer graph hierarchy

You can also specify the ground truth file path as ground_truth_edges_file by using '-t'

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -s pagerank -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```


#### 6. Breaking Cycles via Hierarchy, inferred by TrueSkill

* External Library Requirement: TrueSkill [install](http://trueskill.org/)

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s trueskill
```

* -s trueskill: use TrueSkill to infer graph hierarchy

You can also specify the ground truth file path as ground_truth_edges_file by using '-t'.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s trueskill -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

It will report performance of TS_G, TS_B, TS_F, and TS_Voting (ensembling of TS_G, TS_B and TS_F).



#### 7. Breaking Cycles via Hierarchy, inferred by SocialAgony


The code for computing Social Agony has been put in /agony. You have to compile it first. To compile it sucessfully, you may have to install some packages. Detailes can be viewed at ```/agony/README.md```.

Social Agony computation code is from [Tatti](http://users.ics.aalto.fi/ntatti/software.shtml)

After that run:

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s socialagony
```

* -s socialagony: use SocialAgony to infer graph hierarchy

You can also specify the ground truth file path as ground_truth_edges_file by using '-t'.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s socialagony -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

It will report performance of SA_G, SA_B, SA_F, and SA_Voting (ensembling of SA_G, SA_B and SA_F).


#### 8. Breaking Cycles via Hierarchy, Ensembling Approach

Ensembling TS_G, TS_B, TS_F, SA_G, SA_B and SA_F.

```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s ensembling
```

* -s ensembling: ensembling all above 6 apprpaches

You can also specify the ground truth file path as ground_truth_edges_file by using '-t'. 


```
python remove_cycle_edges_by_hierarchy.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -s ensembling -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

* **This can also report performances of TS_G, TS_B, TS_F, SA_G, SA_B and SA_F individually**, these performance may have slightly difference with running them individually. 
* It can report performance of H_Voting (ensembling of SA_G, SA_B, SA_F, TS_G, TS_B and TS_F)

#### 9. Test on Synthetic Graphs

Instead of testing above methods individually, you can simply run below code to compare performance of all methods on Synthetic Graphs (random generated graphs).

```
python synthetic_performance.py --dir data/ -n 300 -m 2500 -k 300 -l 0
```

* --dir: directory to save all results, 'data/' is in current directory
* -n: number of nodes in the generated random graph
* -m: number of edges in the generated random graph 
* -k: number of extra edges to introduce cycles to the generated random graph 
* -l: control parameter of path length

It will do: 

* generate a random DAG with n nodes and m edges
* introduce k extra edges to this DAG to make it have cycles (l is used to control generated cycle size, if l == 0, it has no constraints on cycle size)
* run all methods to break cycles and report performance


#### 10. Test on Real Datasets

If you already have a graph with cycles, you can run:

```
python break_cycles.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges
```

* -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges : to specify edgeslist file

And if you have ground truth, you can run below commands to report performances:


```
python break_cycles.py -g data/gnm_300_2500_graph_w_extra_300_path_len_0.edges -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges 
```

* -t data/gnm_300_2500_extra_300_path_len_0.edges : to specify ground truth of edges to be removed


#### 11. Visualization 

Visualize peroformance of different methods.

```
python plot_recallPrecision.py --input data/performance.txt --title "RG(1.5K,15K)"
```

* --input data/performance.txt 

file format:

method_name  precision recall f-1Score(optional) numEdgesRemoved(optional) 

**(columns are separated by whitespace)**

First **3** columns must be: method_name, precision, and recall. 

Other columns are optional, such as f-1score and numEdgesRemoved in data/performance.txt.


* --title "RG(1.5K,15K)": file will be saved at: performance_RG(1.5K,15K).pdf

For example, we test algorithms on a random graph (1500,15000) with 500 extra edges added, and get performance saved as:

H_Voting 	0.9369 	0.9500 	0.9434 	507
```

* first column, such as DFS: method name
* second column, such as 0.0140: precision
* third column, such as 0.1820: recall
* forth column, such as 0.0259: f-1 score (optional, will compute f-1 automatically)
* fifth column, such as 1044: number of edges to be removed

visualization will be saved as: performance_RG(1.5K,15K).pdf
